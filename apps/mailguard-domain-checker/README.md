# Mailguard domain checker

This page let's you check your domain for issues with DMARC.

You can also call this page from another page with query params and it will auto run the test and then return you to your page to when you close the modal:

E.g. call the domain checker with `https://domainchecker.mailguard.codes?domain=frontline.codes&redirect-to=https://mailguard.codes`.

This will

- Check the domain `frontline.codes`
- Redirect you back to `https://mailguard.codes` once you close the tester.
